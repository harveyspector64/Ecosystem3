Key Elements and Mechanics
Platform and Hosting:

The game is developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
It's hosted on GitHub for easy sharing and testing on both mobile and desktop platforms.
Game Layout:

Left Panel: Contains available emojis representing different elements of the ecosystem.
Right Main Map: A white, expandable, and scrollable square where the gameplay happens.
Initial Elements:

Players start with a flower bush and a tree emoji.
These can be dragged and placed onto the main map.
Once placed, they cannot be moved again.
Gameplay Mechanics:

Flower Bush:
Attracts 1-3 butterflies after a certain period.
Butterflies have randomized flight paths inspired by natural patterns.
Butterflies land on flowers when their hunger meter drops below 50.
Tree:
Attracts a bird that will roost in the tree.
Birds have a hunger meter that influences their behavior.
Birds will hunt worms that appear after a tree is planted.
Interaction and Emergence:
New emojis become available as elements interact on the map.
Players can experiment with different combinations to see how the ecosystem evolves.
Example: Worm emojis feed birds, leading to more birds, which might affect butterfly populations and flower bushes.
Ecosystem Dynamics:

Animals and plants have simple conditions guiding their behavior.
Players need to balance the ecosystem by adding new elements and observing interactions.
Potential expansions include more animals (e.g., foxes, rabbits) and environmental features (e.g., water, grass).
Day-Night Cycle:

The map transitions to dark mode at night.
Different animals appear at night, like owls, skunks, and raccoons.
Summary
"Emoji Ecosystem" is a minimalist web game developed in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, hosted on GitHub for easy testing on both mobile and desktop platforms. The game features a left-hand panel with draggable emoji elements and a right-hand main map where players create and observe an evolving ecosystem.

Starting with flower bushes and trees, players place these emojis on the map, initiating natural behaviors and interactions. Flower bushes attract butterflies, and trees attract birds that hunt worms. As players experiment with different combinations, new emojis become available, representing additional plants and animals, leading to complex and emergent gameplay.

The game emphasizes a realistic simulation of nature with simple conditions driving animal behavior. A day-night cycle introduces nocturnal animals, adding depth and variety to the ecosystem. Future expansions will include more environmental features and animals, enhancing the interconnected dynamics of the virtual world.
